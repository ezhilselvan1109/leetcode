## [226. Invert Binary Tree ](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/)
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]  
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

### Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: [2,3,1]

### Example 3:

Input: root = []  
Output: []

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

     Hint
     Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.



Example 1:


Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-104 <= root.val <= 104
-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104
